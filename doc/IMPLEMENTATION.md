# Implementation plan

1. Define Connect v1, strict schemas, canonical messages and shared vectors in connect-protocol.
2. Build profile verification and atomic request transitions, then Better Auth endpoints and normal session cookies.
3. Port wallet behavior to Dart, including lifecycle, transport and explicit approval.
4. Exercise cryptographic substitution attacks, concurrency, cross-language bytes and real Better Auth sessions.
5. Add release automation, issue templates, examples and platform documentation.

Research: CAIP-122 provides field vocabulary; Ethereum uses a valid EIP-4361 message with Connect bindings in Resources. Other profiles use a fixed ASCII line format, never JSON serialization. Ed448 = -53; Ed25519 = -19 (IANA/RFC9864). XCB address derivation is SHA3-256(publicKey)[12:] plus network prefix and ICAN checksum in go-core. No XCB registration was found in the CAIP namespace registry: use explicitly local namespace core, not an asserted registered CAIP identifier. Generic Ed25519 uses an explicitly raw-key identity. Bitcoin support will be limited to BIP322 simple P2WPKH. Wallet signing remains delegated to host implementations.
